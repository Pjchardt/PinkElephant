Heya! Pink Elepahnt was made for the Global Game Jam 2014. The theme was something or other...er anyway, oh yeah!

"We do not see things as they are, but as we are."

Here is the repo!  All source can be bound in the Assets folder, other than stuff like the C# solution.

Web, Mac, Windows, and Linuz builds are all in the builds folder.

Stuff we used:
Engine: Unity 4.3 (Used some pro image processing effects)
Language: C#
Pen and Paper provided by BCTC

Sfx: Bfxr, Audacity
Music: Chase Pulse Faster, Cut and Run, Full On, and Mistake the Getaway by Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)
